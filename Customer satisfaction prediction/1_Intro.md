# Customer Support Ticket Satisfaction Prediction

## 1. Project Overview

This project predicts customer satisfaction using features extracted from customer support tickets. By leveraging historical ticket data, a machine learning model is built to classify whether a customer will be **satisfied** or **not satisfied** after their support interaction. This enables businesses to proactively identify at-risk customers, improve support processes, and enhance overall customer experience.

## 2. Dataset

The project uses the `customer_support_tickets.csv` dataset, which includes:

- **Ticket Details:**
    - Ticket ID
    - Ticket Type
    - Ticket Subject
    - Ticket Description
    - Ticket Status
    - Ticket Priority
    - Ticket Channel
- **Customer Information:**
    - Customer Name
    - Customer Email
    - Customer Age
    - Customer Gender
- **Product/Purchase Information:**
    - Product Purchased
    - Date of Purchase
- **Time-Related Metrics:**
    - First Response Time
    - Time to Resolution
- **Target Variable:**
    - Customer Satisfaction Rating (used to derive the binary satisfaction outcome)

## 3. Problem Statement

Customer satisfaction is a critical business metric. Early prediction of dissatisfaction allows for timely intervention and service improvement. This project addresses the challenge of automatically identifying satisfaction levels from support ticket data, which includes complex categorical features, time-based metrics, and class imbalance (more satisfied than dissatisfied customers).

## 4. Methodology

**Workflow Steps:**

### Data Loading & Initial Inspection
- Load `customer_support_tickets.csv`
- Perform initial data checks

### Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values (drop rows with missing satisfaction ratings)
- Convert columns to appropriate data types (e.g., datetime)

### Feature Engineering
- **Target Variable Creation:** Convert Customer Satisfaction Rating (float) to binary:
    - 1 for ratings â‰¥ 4
    - 0 for ratings < 4
- **Time-Based Features:** Calculate `time_to_resolution_hours` and `first_response_time_hours`
- **Categorical Age Groups:** Bin Customer Age into `customer_age_group` categories

### Data Preprocessing
- **Numerical Feature Scaling:** Use `StandardScaler` to normalize numerical features
- **Categorical Feature Encoding:** Use `OneHotEncoder` for categorical variables
- **ColumnTransformer:** Apply transformations systematically
- **Handling Class Imbalance:** Use SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance classes

### Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning
- Build an `imblearn.pipeline.Pipeline` with preprocessing, SMOTE, and classifier
- Use `RandomForestClassifier` as the primary model
- Apply `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning (e.g., `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, SMOTE `sampling_strategy`)
- Train a Logistic Regression model for comparison

### Model Evaluation
- Evaluate the best model on an unseen test set
- Use metrics: **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix**

### Model Saving
- Save the trained model (including preprocessor and SMOTE) using `joblib`

## 5. Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- imbalanced-learn (`imblearn`)
- joblib

## 6. Future Enhancements

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Utilize the Ticket Description and Ticket Subject fields by applying NLP techniques (e.g., TF-IDF, Word Embeddings, Sentiment Analysis) to extract more nuanced features.
- **Explore More Models:** Experiment with advanced classification algorithms such as Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) or Support Vector Machines.
- **Deeper Hyperparameter Tuning:** Expand the search space for GridSearchCV or use more efficient tuning methods like RandomizedSearchCV or Bayesian Optimization.
- **Model Interpretability:** Implement tools like SHAP or LIME to better understand the model's predictions and identify key drivers of customer satisfaction.
- **Deployment:** Develop a full-fledged API (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI) to serve real-time predictions, possibly containerized with Docker.
- **Time-Series Analysis:** If ticket submission times are truly sequential, explore time-series specific features or models to capture temporal patterns.
